<div id="implementation"><div>

## ðŸ§  Implementation

### *Performence*

- Loading expected modules at the idle time of the browser

- Using the onPushStrategy in order to reduce the running of the change detection,
And beyond performance contributes by keep controlling and understanding the logic.

### *Scalable, Loosely Coupling, Testable And Maintainable*

- Thin Application: the environment files, styles and assets, have been exported to directories so that they are external to the application.
Therefore, they have the ability to be shared with another additional future apps or micro frontends.

- Keeping the components, weakly associated with each other.

And all the components that are intended to provide a service, are reusable that of course also sit in dedicated libraries.

All this in order to allow easy changes, easy access, work order and realization of unitests more easily

### *Custom Design*

- Custom Angular Material Theme

- Angular Animations

- Css StoryTelling

### *More...*

- State Management by Akita. And in addition, some of the states were implemented, without involvement from Akita. in order to practice different patterns, as part of learning.

- HTML Semantic Elements for accessiblity
