# ðŸ§  Implementation

### *Performence*

- Loading expected modules at the idle time of the browser

- Using the onPushStrategy in order to reduce the running of the change detection,
And beyond performance contributes by keep controlling and understanding the logic.

### *Scalable And Thin Application*

The environment files, styles and assets, have been exported to directories so that they are external to the application

In addition, all the components that are intended to provide a service, are reusable and generics that of course also sit in dedicated libraries.

All this in order to allow easy changes, easy access, work order and realization of unitests more easily

### *Design*

- Custom Angular Material Theme

- Angular Animations

- Css StoryTelling

### *More...*

- State Management by Akita. And in addition, some of the states were implemented, without involvement from Akita. in order to practice different patterns, as part of learning.

- HTML Semantic Elements for accessiblity
